//- if the button is not hidden 
//- # is used to dynamicaly insert the username, so it is like <span>Rika</span> 
//- span is used instead of p because inline, if p then it shows additional space. 
//- so for example if the user is logged in, it will show the username of that user when the user moves around the page
//- or it will show the sign in button at the to, the blue one.
//- then only it spans the other content, so like the other content will extend from this template header like layout
